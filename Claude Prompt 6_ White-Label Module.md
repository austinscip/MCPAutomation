You are an expert developer and no-code automation architect.

Build the White-Label Reseller module for an AI-Powered MCP Automation Studio. This module should allow agencies to:

\- Clone existing automation workflows.  
\- Add custom logos and domains for branding.  
\- Manage client access permissions securely.

This feature should only be available to users who pay a $50–$100/month add-on fee.

Requirements:

1\. Structure all code into modular, reusable functions suitable for:

   \- Bubble (JavaScript plugin or API connector)  
   \- Zapier’s MCP SDK (with triggers, actions, and searches)  
   \- Traditional backend services (Node.js, serverless, Express)

2\. Avoid hardcoding any values; use parameters instead.

3\. For each function, provide:

   \- A clear description of its purpose.  
   \- Sample input parameters.  
   \- Example usage.

4\. Include JSON schemas for inputs and outputs wherever applicable.

5\. Prioritize maintainable, readable code and brief explanations for each function.

Output the complete set of functions and explanations for the White-Label Reseller module.

Focus on security best practices for client access management.

Do not include any unrelated code or explanations.
