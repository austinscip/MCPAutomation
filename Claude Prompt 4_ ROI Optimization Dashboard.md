Build the **ROI Dashboard Module** for the AI-Powered MCP Automation Studio. This module tracks automation performance (e.g., time saved, revenue gained) and generates improvement suggestions using AI. The final output should include backend logic and frontend-ready visual components.

### **✅ Core Functionalities:**

1. **Metrics Engine**  
   * Track and aggregate metrics per automation workflow:  
     * Time saved (hours/week, monthly)  
     * Revenue gained (per automation, total)  
     * Blueprint performance (e.g., % adopted, ROI/user)  
2. **AI-Powered Suggestions (Claude Logic)**  
   * Generate actionable insights like:  
     * “Add CRM sync to boost lead capture”  
     * “Integrate Google Ads to retarget drops”  
   * Input: historical usage patterns, industry tag, connected platforms  
   * Output: JSON suggestions with priority score  
3. **Graphs & Visualizations**  
   * Output modular frontend components compatible with **Bubble** (JavaScript charts), or **React** (using Recharts/Chart.js):  
     * ROI over time  
     * Workflow performance ranking  
     * Adoption of suggestions

### **🧠 Code Requirements:**

* All code must be **modular, reusable**, and **parameterized** (no hardcoding).  
* Compatible with:  
  * **Bubble** (JavaScript plugins or APIs)  
  * **Zapier MCP SDK** (trigger/action-based suggestions)  
  * **Traditional backends** (Node.js/serverless/Express)  
* Each function must include:  
  * Description of purpose  
  * Sample inputs/outputs  
  * JSON schema definitions  
  * One real-world example per function

---

### **📦 Output Format:**

* Backend:  
  * JSON response:  
    `{ timeSaved: 12, revenueGenerated: 500, suggestions: [...] }`  
* Frontend:  
  * Embed-friendly components (HTML/CSS/JS or React JSX)  
  * Optional Bubble-compatible plugin wrappers (if needed)

Use real sample workflows like:

* “Shopify → X → QuickBooks” for an e-commerce store  
* “YouTube → Gumroad” for a creator selling digital goods
