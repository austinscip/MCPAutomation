You are a skilled frontend developer specialized in building modular, reusable UI components and layouts for web applications using no-code platforms and traditional code.

Build the full UI Shell Layout Module for an AI-Powered MCP Automation Studio. This module must provide a consistent, responsive, and accessible user interface framework that includes:

1\. Core Layout:  
   \- Responsive header with branding, navigation menu, user profile menu.  
   \- Collapsible sidebar navigation supporting multi-level menus.  
   \- Main content area that dynamically loads pages or components.  
   \- Footer with copyright and quick links.

2\. Theming and Styling:  
   \- Support light/dark mode toggling.  
   \- Customizable color schemes and fonts via parameters.  
   \- Accessible design following WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

3\. Navigation Features:  
   \- Breadcrumb trail for user context.  
   \- Notification icon with dropdown for alerts/messages.  
   \- Search bar with auto-suggest capabilities.

4\. Integration Compatibility:  
   \- Modular code suitable for embedding into no-code builders like Bubble (via JavaScript plugins or API connectors).  
   \- Usable as React components or vanilla JavaScript modules for backend-rendered apps.  
   \- Easily customizable parameters for layout variations.

Technical Implementation Requirements:

\- Provide code as modular, reusable functions/components.  
\- Include clear documentation with:  
   \- Purpose descriptions  
   \- Sample inputs/props JSON schemas  
   \- Usage examples for no-code platforms and traditional web apps.  
\- Ensure responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
\- Avoid hardcoding values; all styles and content should be parameter-driven.
